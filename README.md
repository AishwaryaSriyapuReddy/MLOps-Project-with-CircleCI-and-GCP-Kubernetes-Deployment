## Project Overview
This MLOps project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data ingestion to model deployment, using modern MLOps tools. The pipeline includes:
- ✅ Model development and testing in **Jupyter Notebook**
- 🛠️ Modular refactoring into Python classes
- 🌐 Flask-based user-friendly web interface
- 🐳 Docker containerization
- ☁️ Deployment on GCP's **Kubernetes Cluster (GKE)**
- 🔁 CI/CD with **CircleCI**
- 🔒 Versioning via **GitHub**

## Architecture 
This project follows a modern CI/CD-based MLOps architecture powered by CircleCI, Docker, and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
